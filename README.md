To log in use one of pre-made accounts:
username: pawelx14@gmail.com password: HeadChef
username: pawelx140@gmail.com password: NormalChef
username: pawelx14@04gmail.com password: DeliveryDriver

For now, users can only create their account's but are not able to register to any fridge. That is done manually via firebase. I'll change that later.
