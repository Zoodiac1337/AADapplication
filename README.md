To log in use one of pre-made accounts:


username: pawelx14@gmail.com password: HeadChef

username: pawelx140@gmail.com password: NormalChef

username: pawelx1404@gmail.com password: DeliveryDriver

The fridge ID to type in: 12345

For now adding fridges is done manually by typing in and does not save after closing the app. That will be replaced by QR code scanning later on.


For now, users can only create their account's but are not able to register to any fridge. That is done manually via firebase. I'll change that later.
